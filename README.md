Model used for population prediction

As the population of a country can take any values and not some selected discrete values we realize that this is a regression problem and not a classification problem. Linear Regression is one of the most basic algorithms of Machine Learning. This algorithm lets us predict numerical data. Hence we use Linear Regression to solve this problem.
Linear Regression is a Supervised Machine Learning Model for finding the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. Linear regression performs the task to predict the response (dependent) variable value (y) based on a given (independent) explanatory variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y (output).
